I wish you love. Let it will shine
Like a million beautiful bright stars.
Enjoy these feelings, have a fun
And wish you melting in hot hugs.
And on this great Valentine’s Day
Have a perfect partner next to you.
Let he gives you happy every day
And whispers gently “I love you!”

Do you feel love in the air?
Valentine has come to you.
He will give you warmth, I swear,
And the calmness you need, too.
Let this day make you so sunny
That you’ll start to dance and sing
Merry songs say: “Oh, money
Is simply nothing when love’s your dream.”

My sweetie, you look so divine!
Let’s mark this happy Valentine.
God bless you with much luck, my love.
I want to kiss you and to hug.

Let your life be filled with love.
Let it gives you warmth, happiness.
And gorgeous days, the hottest nights,
Joyful surprises, prettiness.
Let this love gives you the strong wings
To fly free brightly every day.
And let it always loudly sings
In your great heart. Happy Valentine’s Day!

What lovely feast-day comes to us —
It`s Saintly Valentine!
There are the candles, wine-glass,
In eyes bright sparkles shine.
And everywhere there are hearts,
Which show us fairy love.
Who wants to play the Angels` darts?
And find your second half.

You are just everything to me,
My angel on the earth.
Let our love forever be
An endless, blissful mirth.
Your dazzling smile will never wane,
Like tenderness of spring.
May birdies by your windowpane
Forever gaily sing.
